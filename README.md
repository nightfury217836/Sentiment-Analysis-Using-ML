# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning | End-to-End Resume Project with Python

Learn how to build a Sentiment Analysis Project using Machine Learning and NLP in Python! 🚀
In this full step-by-step tutorial, we’ll analyze real-world text data and classify emotions as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using powerful machine learning algorithms.

This Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Project is perfect for data science, AI, and NLP enthusiasts who want to build a real-world project for their portfolio and understand how text analytics and natural language processing work in practice.

We’ll cover everything — from data preprocessing and text vectorization to model training, evaluation, and visualization — all explained clearly using Python.

🧠 What You’ll Learn:

✅ How to clean and preprocess text data (remove stopwords, punctuation, lemmatization)
✅ Extract features using TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW)
✅ Build and compare ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost)
✅ Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
✅ Visualize sentiment distribution and word clouds
✅ Deploy your sentiment analysis model for real-world use
